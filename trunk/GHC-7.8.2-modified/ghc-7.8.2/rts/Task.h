/* 
   Definition of a Task
   --------------------
 
   A task is an OSThread that runs Haskell code.  Every OSThread that
   runs inside the RTS, whether as a worker created by the RTS or via
   an in-call from C to Haskell, has an associated Task.  The first
   time an OS thread calls into Haskell it is allocated a Task, which
   remains until the RTS is shut down.

   There is a one-to-one relationship between OSThreads and Tasks.
   The Task for an OSThread is kept in thread-local storage, and can
   be retrieved at any time using myTask().
   
   In the THREADED_RTS build, multiple Tasks may all be running
   Haskell code simultaneously. A task relinquishes its Capability
   when it is asked to evaluate an external (C) call.

   Ownership of Task
   -----------------

   Task ownership is a little tricky.  The default situation is that
   the Task is an OS-thread-local structure that is owned by the OS
   thread named in task->id.  An OS thread not currently executing
   Haskell code might call newBoundTask() at any time, which assumes
   that it has access to the Task for the current OS thread.

   The all_next and all_prev fields of a Task are owned by
   all_tasks_mutex, which must also be taken if we want to create or
   free a Task.

   For an OS thread in Haskell, if (task->cap->running_task != task),
   then the Task is owned by the owner of the parent data structure on
   which it is sleeping; for example, if the task is sleeping on
   spare_workers field of a Capability, then the owner of the
   Capability has access to the Task.

   When a task is migrated from sleeping on one Capability to another,
   its task->cap field must be modified.  When the task wakes up, it
   will read the new value of task->cap to find out which Capability
   it belongs to.  Hence some synchronisation is required on
   task->cap, and this is why we have task->lock.

   If the Task is not currently owned by task->id, then the thread is
   either

      (a) waiting on the condition task->cond.  The Task is either
         (1) a bound Task, the TSO will be on a queue somewhere
	 (2) a worker task, on the spare_workers queue of task->cap.

     (b) making a foreign call.  The InCall will be on the
         suspended_ccalls list.

   We re-establish ownership in each case by respectively

      (a) the task is currently blocked in yieldCapability().
          This call will return when we have ownership of the Task and
          a Capability.  The Capability we get might not be the same
	  as the one we had when we called yieldCapability().
          
      (b) we must call resumeThread(task), which will safely establish
          ownership of the Task and a Capability.
