   Weak Pointers

   traverse_weak_ptr_list is called possibly many times during garbage
   collection.  It returns a flag indicating whether it did any work
   (i.e. called evacuate on any live pointers).

   Invariant: traverse_weak_ptr_list is called when the heap is in an
   idempotent state.  That means that there are no pending
   evacuate/scavenge operations.  This invariant helps the weak
   pointer code decide which weak pointers are dead - if there are no
   new live weak pointers, then all the currently unreachable ones are
   dead.

   For generational GC: we just don't try to finalize weak pointers in
   older generations than the one we're collecting.  This could
   probably be optimised by keeping per-generation lists of weak
   pointers, but for a few weak pointers this scheme will work.

   There are three distinct stages to processing weak pointers:

   - weak_stage == WeakPtrs

     We process all the weak pointers whos keys are alive (evacuate
     their values and finalizers), and repeat until we can find no new
     live keys.  If no live keys are found in this pass, then we
     evacuate the finalizers of all the dead weak pointers in order to
     run them.

   - weak_stage == WeakThreads

     Now, we discover which *threads* are still alive.  Pointers to
     threads from the all_threads and main thread lists are the
     weakest of all: a pointers from the finalizer of a dead weak
     pointer can keep a thread alive.  Any threads found to be unreachable
     are evacuated and placed on the resurrected_threads list so we 
     can send them a signal later.

   - weak_stage == WeakDone

     No more evacuation is done.
