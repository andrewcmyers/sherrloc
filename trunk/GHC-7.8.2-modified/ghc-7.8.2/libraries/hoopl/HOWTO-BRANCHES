Here's how to work on Hoopl without breaking GHC.

  - Hoopl maintainers should work on the branch "develop", where they
    need not validate changes against GHC.

  - GHC uses the 'master' branch, and makes changes there from time to
    time as necessary to keep GHC working

  - GHC central merges master with develop occasionally (e.g. before a
    new GHC stable branch is created).

  - Intermediate releases can be made from develop, although we have
    to ensure that each GHC release ships with a released version of
    the library.  (As of May 2012, Ian Lynagh coordinates with the
    package maintainers to make this happen.)
