This repository contains things related to

              Hoopl: A Higher-Order OPtimization Library

** The closest thing we have to a SAMPLE CLIENT is in ./testing **

Directory     Contents

paper/        A paper about Hoopl
prototypes/   A sampling of prototypes and early designs
src/          The current official sources to the Cabal package
testing/      Tests, including a sample client.  See ./testing/README.

To build the library, change to the src directory and run

  cabal configure --prefix=$HOME --user   # we have no idea what this means
  cabal build
  cabal install --enable-documentation

You'll need a Haskell Platform, which should include appropriate
versions of Cabal and GHC.

To upload to Hackage,

  cabal sdist
  cabal upload dist/something.tar.gz
