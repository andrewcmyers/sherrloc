Synopsis: A preprocessor that helps with writing Haskell bindings to C code
Description:
    The hsc2hs program can be used to automate some parts of the
    process of writing Haskell bindings to C code.  It reads an
    almost-Haskell source file with embedded special constructs, and
    outputs a real Haskell file with these constructs processed, based
    on information taken from some C headers.  The extra constructs
    provide Haskell counterparts of C types, values of C constants,
    including sizes of C types, and access to fields of C structs.
    .
