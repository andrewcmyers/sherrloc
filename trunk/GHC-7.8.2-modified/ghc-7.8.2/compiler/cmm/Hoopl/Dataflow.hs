{-

The forward and backward cases are not dual.  In the forward case, the
entry points are known, and one simply traverses the body blocks from
those points.  In the backward case, something is known about the exit
points, but this information is essentially useless, because we don't
actually have a dual graph (that is, one with edges reversed) to
compute with.  (Even if we did have a dual graph, it would not avail
us---a backward analysis must include reachable blocks that don't
reach the exit, as in a procedure that loops forever and has side
effects.)

{-  Note [TxFactBase invariants]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The TxFactBase is used only during a fixpoint iteration (or "sweep"),
and accumulates facts (and the transformed code) during the fixpoint
iteration.

* tfb_fbase increases monotonically, across all sweeps

* At the beginning of each sweep
      tfb_cha  = NoChange
      tfb_lbls = {}

* During each sweep we process each block in turn.  Processing a block
  is done thus:
    1.  Read from tfb_fbase the facts for its entry label (forward)
        or successors labels (backward)
    2.  Transform those facts into new facts for its successors (forward)
        or entry label (backward)
    3.  Augment tfb_fbase with that info
  We call the labels read in step (1) the "in-labels" of the sweep

* The field tfb_lbls is the set of in-labels of all blocks that have
  been processed so far this sweep, including the block that is
  currently being processed.  tfb_lbls is initialised to {}.  It is a
  subset of the Labels of the *original* (not transformed) blocks.

* The tfb_cha field is set to SomeChange iff we decide we need to
  perform another iteration of the fixpoint loop. It is initialsed to NoChange.

  Specifically, we set tfb_cha to SomeChange in step (3) iff
    (a) The fact in tfb_fbase for a block L changes
    (b) L is in tfb_lbls
  Reason: until a label enters the in-labels its accumuated fact in tfb_fbase
  has not been read, hence cannot affect the outcome

Note [Unreachable blocks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A block that is not in the domain of tfb_fbase is "currently unreachable".
A currently-unreachable block is not even analyzed.  Reason: consider 
constant prop and this graph, with entry point L1:
  L1: x:=3; goto L4
  L2: x:=4; goto L4
  L4: if x>3 goto L2 else goto L5
Here L2 is actually unreachable, but if we process it with bottom input fact,
we'll propagate (x=4) to L4, and nuke the otherwise-good rewriting of L4.

* If a currently-unreachable block is not analyzed, then its rewritten
  graph will not be accumulated in tfb_rg.  And that is good:
  unreachable blocks simply do not appear in the output.

* Note that clients must be careful to provide a fact (even if bottom)
  for each entry point. Otherwise useful blocks may be garbage collected.

* Note that updateFact must set the change-flag if a label goes from
  not-in-fbase to in-fbase, even if its fact is bottom.  In effect the
  real fact lattice is
       UNR
       bottom
       the points above bottom

* Even if the fact is going from UNR to bottom, we still call the
  client's fact_join function because it might give the client
  some useful debugging information.

* All of this only applies for *forward* ixpoints.  For the backward
  case we must treat every block as reachable; it might finish with a
  'return', and therefore have no successors, for example.

{-
Note [no old fact]

We know that the new_fact is >= _|_, so we don't need to join.  However,
if the new fact is also _|_, and we have already analysed its block,
we don't need to record a change.  So there's a tradeoff here.  It turns
out that always recording a change is faster.
