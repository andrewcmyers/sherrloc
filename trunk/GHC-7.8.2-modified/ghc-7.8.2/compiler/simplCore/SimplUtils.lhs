A SimplCont allows the simplifier to traverse the expression in a
zipper-like fashion.  The SimplCont represents the rest of the expression,
"above" the point of interest.

You can also think of a SimplCont as an "evaluation context", using
that term in the way it is used for operational semantics. This is the
way I usually think of it, For example you'll often see a syntax for
evaluation context looking like
        C ::= []  |  C e   |  case C of alts  |  C `cast` co
That's the kind of thing we are doing here, and I use that syntax in
the comments.


Key points:
  * A SimplCont describes a *strict* context (just like
    evaluation contexts do).  E.g. Just [] is not a SimplCont

  * A SimplCont describes a context that *does not* bind
    any variables.  E.g. \x. [] is not a SimplCont

                        --          the context, and hence the inliner

In both (ApplyTo dup _ env k)

the following invariants hold

  (a) if dup = OkToDup, then continuation k is also ok-to-dup
  (b) if dup = OkToDup or Simplified, the subst-env is empty
      (and and hence no need to re-simplify)

Note [Interesting call context]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We want to avoid inlining an expression where there can't possibly be
any gain, such as in an argument position.  Hence, if the continuation
is interesting (eg. a case scrutinee, application etc.) then we
inline, otherwise we don't.

Previously some_benefit used to return True only if the variable was
applied to some value arguments.  This didn't work:

        let x = _coerce_ (T Int) Int (I# 3) in
        case _coerce_ Int (T Int) x of
                I# y -> ....

we want to inline x, but can't see that it's a constructor in a case
scrutinee position, and some_benefit is False.

Another example:

dMonadST = _/\_ t -> :Monad (g1 _@_ t, g2 _@_ t, g3 _@_ t)

....  case dMonadST _@_ x0 of (a,b,c) -> ....

we'd really like to inline dMonadST here, but we *don't* want to
inline if the case expression is just

        case x of y { DEFAULT -> ... }

since we can just eliminate this case instead (x is in WHNF).  Similar
applies when x is bound to a lambda expression.  Hence
contIsInteresting looks for case expressions with just a single
default case.

interestingCallContext :: SimplCont -> CallCtxt

interestingCallContext cont

                                        -- motivation to inline. See Note [Cast then apply]
                                        -- in CoreUnfold

    interesting (CoerceIt _ cont)   = interesting cont
        -- If this call is the arg of a strict function, the context
        -- is a bit interesting.  If we inline here, we may get useful
        -- evaluation information to avoid repeated evals: e.g.
        --      x + (y * z)
        -- Here the contIsInteresting makes the '*' keener to inline,
        -- which in turn exposes a constructor which makes the '+' inline.
        -- Assuming that +,* aren't small enough to inline regardless.
        --
        -- It's also very important to inline in a strict context for things
        -- like
        --              foldr k z (f x)
        -- Here, the context of (f x) is strict, and if f's unfolding is
        -- a build it's *great* to inline it here.  So we must ensure that
        -- the context for (f x) is not totally uninteresting.

Note [Inlining in gentle mode]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Something is inlined if
   (i)   the sm_inline flag is on, AND
   (ii)  the thing has an INLINE pragma, AND
   (iii) the thing is inlinable in the earliest phase.

Example of why (iii) is important:
  {-# INLINE [~1] g #-}
  g = ...

  {-# INLINE f #-}
  f x = g (g x)

If we were to inline g into f's inlining, then an importing module would
never be able to do
        f e --> g (g e) ---> RULE fires
because the InlineRule for f has had g inlined into it.

On the other hand, it is bad not to do ANY inlining into an
InlineRule, because then recursive knots in instance declarations
don't get unravelled.

However, *sometimes* SimplGently must do no call-site inlining at all
(hence sm_inline = False).  Before full laziness we must be careful
not to inline wrappers, because doing so inhibits floating
    e.g. ...(case f x of ...)...
    ==> ...(case (case x of I# x# -> fw x#) of ...)...
    ==> ...(case x of I# x# -> case fw x# of ...)...
and now the redex (f x) isn't floatable any more.

The no-inlining thing is also important for Template Haskell.  You might be
compiling in one-shot mode with -O2; but when TH compiles a splice before
running it, we don't want to use -O2.  Indeed, we don't want to inline
anything, because the byte-code interpreter might get confused about
unboxed tuples and suchlike.

Note [Simplifying inside InlineRules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We must take care with simplification inside InlineRules (which come from
INLINE pragmas).

First, consider the following example
        let f = \pq -> BIG
        in
        let g = \y -> f y y
            {-# INLINE g #-}
        in ...g...g...g...g...g...
Now, if that's the ONLY occurrence of f, it might be inlined inside g,
and thence copied multiple times when g is inlined. HENCE we treat
any occurrence in an InlineRule as a multiple occurrence, not a single
one; see OccurAnal.addRuleUsage.

Second, we do want *do* to some modest rules/inlining stuff in InlineRules,
partly to eliminate senseless crap, and partly to break the recursive knots
generated by instance declarations.

However, suppose we have
        {-# INLINE <act> f #-}
        f = <rhs>
meaning "inline f in phases p where activation <act>(p) holds".
Then what inlinings/rules can we apply to the copy of <rhs> captured in
f's InlineRule?  Our model is that literally <rhs> is substituted for
f when it is inlined.  So our conservative plan (implemented by
updModeForInlineRules) is this:

  -------------------------------------------------------------
  When simplifying the RHS of an InlineRule, set the phase to the
  phase in which the InlineRule first becomes active
  -------------------------------------------------------------

That ensures that

  a) Rules/inlinings that *cease* being active before p will
     not apply to the InlineRule rhs, consistent with it being
     inlined in its *original* form in phase p.

  b) Rules/inlinings that only become active *after* p will
     not apply to the InlineRule rhs, again to be consistent with
     inlining the *original* rhs in phase p.

For example,
        {-# INLINE f #-}
        f x = ...g...

        {-# NOINLINE [1] g #-}
        g y = ...

        {-# RULE h g = ... #-}
Here we must not inline g into f's RHS, even when we get to phase 0,
because when f is later inlined into some other module we want the
rule for h to fire.

Similarly, consider
        {-# INLINE f #-}
        f x = ...g...

        g y = ...
and suppose that there are auto-generated specialisations and a strictness
wrapper for g.  The specialisations get activation AlwaysActive, and the
strictness wrapper get activation (ActiveAfter 0).  So the strictness
wrepper fails the test and won't be inlined into f's InlineRule. That
means f can inline, expose the specialised call to g, so the specialisation
rules can fire.

A note about wrappers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's also important not to inline a worker back into a wrapper.
A wrapper looks like
        wraper = inline_me (\x -> ...worker... )
Normally, the inline_me prevents the worker getting inlined into
the wrapper (initially, the worker's only call site!).  But,
if the wrapper is sure to be called, the strictness analyser will
mark it 'demanded', so when the RHS is simplified, it'll get an ArgOf
continuation.

preInlineUnconditionally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@preInlineUnconditionally@ examines a bndr to see if it is used just
once in a completely safe way, so that it is safe to discard the
binding inline its RHS at the (unique) usage site, REGARDLESS of how
big the RHS might be.  If this is the case we don't simplify the RHS
first, but just inline it un-simplified.

This is much better than first simplifying a perhaps-huge RHS and then
inlining and re-simplifying it.  Indeed, it can be at least quadratically
better.  Consider

        x1 = e1
        x2 = e2[x1]
        x3 = e3[x2]
        ...etc...
        xN = eN[xN-1]

We may end up simplifying e1 N times, e2 N-1 times, e3 N-3 times etc.
This can happen with cascades of functions too:

        f1 = \x1.e1
        f2 = \xs.e2[f1]
        f3 = \xs.e3[f3]
        ...etc...

THE MAIN INVARIANT is this:

        ----  preInlineUnconditionally invariant -----
   IF preInlineUnconditionally chooses to inline x = <rhs>
   THEN doing the inlining should not change the occurrence
        info for the free vars of <rhs>
        ----------------------------------------------

For example, it's tempting to look at trivial binding like
        x = y
and inline it unconditionally.  But suppose x is used many times,
but this is the unique occurrence of y.  Then inlining x would change
y's occurrence info, which breaks the invariant.  It matters: y
might have a BIG rhs, which will now be dup'd at every occurrenc of x.


Even RHSs labelled InlineMe aren't caught here, because there might be
no benefit from inlining at the call site.

[Sept 01] Don't unconditionally inline a top-level thing, because that
can simply make a static thing into something built dynamically.  E.g.
        x = (a,b)
        main = \s -> h x

[Remember that we treat \s as a one-shot lambda.]  No point in
inlining x unless there is something interesting about the call site.

But watch out: if you aren't careful, some useful foldr/build fusion
can be lost (most notably in spectral/hartel/parstof) because the
foldr didn't see the build.  Doing the dynamic allocation isn't a big
deal, in fact, but losing the fusion can be.  But the right thing here
seems to be to do a callSiteInline based on the fact that there is
something interesting about the call site (it's strict).  Hmm.  That
seems a bit fragile.

Conclusion: inline top level things gaily until Phase 0 (the last
phase), at which point don't.

Note [pre/postInlineUnconditionally in gentle mode]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Even in gentle mode we want to do preInlineUnconditionally.  The
reason is that too little clean-up happens if you don't inline
use-once things.  Also a bit of inlining is *good* for full laziness;
it can expose constant sub-expressions.  Example in
spectral/mandel/Mandel.hs, where the mandelset function gets a useful
let-float if you inline windowToViewport

However, as usual for Gentle mode, do not inline things that are
inactive in the intial stages.  See Note [Gentle mode].

Note [InlineRule and preInlineUnconditionally]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Surprisingly, do not pre-inline-unconditionally Ids with INLINE pragmas!
Example

   {-# INLINE f #-}
   f :: Eq a => a -> a
   f x = ...

   fInt :: Int -> Int
   fInt = f Int dEqInt

   ...fInt...fInt...fInt...

Here f occurs just once, in the RHS of f1. But if we inline it there
we'll lose the opportunity to inline at each of fInt's call sites.
The INLINE pragma will only inline when the application is saturated
for exactly this reason; and we don't want PreInlineUnconditionally
to second-guess it.  A live example is Trac #3736.
    c.f. Note [InlineRule and postInlineUnconditionally]

Note [Top-level botomming Ids]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Don't inline top-level Ids that are bottoming, even if they are used just
once, because FloatOut has gone to some trouble to extract them out.
Inlining them won't make the program run faster!

Note [Do not inline CoVars unconditionally]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Coercion variables appear inside coercions, and the RHS of a let-binding
is a term (not a coercion) so we can't necessarily inline the latter in
the former.

\begin{code}

postInlineUnconditionally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@postInlineUnconditionally@ decides whether to unconditionally inline
a thing based on the form of its RHS; in particular if it has a
trivial RHS.  If so, we can inline and discard the binding altogether.

NB: a loop breaker has must_keep_binding = True and non-loop-breakers
only have *forward* references. Hence, it's safe to discard the binding

NOTE: This isn't our last opportunity to inline.  We're at the binding
site right now, and we'll get another opportunity when we get to the
ocurrence(s)

Note that we do this unconditional inlining only for trival RHSs.
Don't inline even WHNFs inside lambdas; doing so may simply increase
allocation when the function is called. This isn't the last chance; see
NOTE above.

NB: Even inline pragmas (e.g. IMustBeINLINEd) are ignored here Why?
Because we don't even want to inline them into the RHS of constructor
arguments. See NOTE above

NB: At one time even NOINLINE was ignored here: if the rhs is trivial
it's best to inline it anyway.  We often get a=E; b=a from desugaring,
with both a and b marked NOINLINE.  But that seems incompatible with
our new view that inlining is like a RULE, so I'm sticking to the 'active'
story for now.

Note [Top level and postInlineUnconditionally]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We don't do postInlineUnconditionally for top-level things (even for
ones that are trivial):

  * Doing so will inline top-level error expressions that have been
    carefully floated out by FloatOut.  More generally, it might
    replace static allocation with dynamic.

  * Even for trivial expressions there's a problem.  Consider
      {-# RULE "foo" forall (xs::[T]). reverse xs = ruggle xs #-}
      blah xs = reverse xs
      ruggle = sort
    In one simplifier pass we might fire the rule, getting
      blah xs = ruggle xs
    but in *that* simplifier pass we must not do postInlineUnconditionally
    on 'ruggle' because then we'll have an unbound occurrence of 'ruggle'

    If the rhs is trivial it'll be inlined by callSiteInline, and then
    the binding will be dead and discarded by the next use of OccurAnal

  * There is less point, because the main goal is to get rid of local
    bindings used in multiple case branches.

  * The inliner should inline trivial things at call sites anyway.

Note [InlineRule and postInlineUnconditionally]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Do not do postInlineUnconditionally if the Id has an InlineRule, otherwise
we lose the unfolding.  Example

     -- f has InlineRule with rhs (e |> co)
     --   where 'e' is big
     f = e |> co

Then there's a danger we'll optimise to

     f' = e
     f = f' |> co

and now postInlineUnconditionally, losing the InlineRule on f.  Now f'
won't inline because 'e' is too big.

Note [Eta expanding lambdas]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In general we *do* want to eta-expand lambdas. Consider
   f (\x -> case x of (a,b) -> \s -> blah)
where 's' is a state token, and hence can be eta expanded.  This
showed up in the code for GHc.IO.Handle.Text.hPutChar, a rather
important function!

The eta-expansion will never happen unless we do it now.  (Well, it's
possible that CorePrep will do it, but CorePrep only has a half-baked
eta-expander that can't deal with casts.  So it's much better to do it
here.)

However, when the lambda is let-bound, as the RHS of a let, we have a
better eta-expander (in the form of tryEtaExpandRhs), so we don't
bother to try expansion in mkLam in that case; hence the contIsRhs
guard.

Note [Casts and lambdas]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
        (\x. (\y. e) `cast` g1) `cast` g2
There is a danger here that the two lambdas look separated, and the
full laziness pass might float an expression to between the two.

So this equation in mkLam' floats the g1 out, thus:
        (\x. e `cast` g1)  -->  (\x.e) `cast` (tx -> g1)
where x:tx.

In general, this floats casts outside lambdas, where (I hope) they
might meet and cancel with some other cast:
        \x. e `cast` co   ===>   (\x. e) `cast` (tx -> co)
        /\a. e `cast` co  ===>   (/\a. e) `cast` (/\a. co)
        /\g. e `cast` co  ===>   (/\g. e) `cast` (/\g. co)
                          (if not (g `in` co))

Notice that it works regardless of 'e'.  Originally it worked only
if 'e' was itself a lambda, but in some cases that resulted in
fruitless iteration in the simplifier.  A good example was when
compiling Text.ParserCombinators.ReadPrec, where we had a definition
like    (\x. Get `cast` g)
where Get is a constructor with nonzero arity.  Then mkLam eta-expanded
the Get, and the next iteration eta-reduced it, and then eta-expanded
it again.

Note also the side condition for the case of coercion binders.
It does not make sense to transform
        /\g. e `cast` g  ==>  (/\g.e) `cast` (/\g.g)
because the latter is not well-kinded.

Note [Eta-expanding at let bindings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We now eta expand at let-bindings, which is where the payoff comes.
The most significant thing is that we can do a simple arity analysis
(in CoreArity.findRhsArity), which we can't do for free-floating lambdas

One useful consequence is this example:
   genMap :: C a => ...
   {-# INLINE genMap #-}
   genMap f xs = ...

   myMap :: D a => ...
   {-# INLINE myMap #-}
   myMap = genMap

Notice that 'genMap' should only inline if applied to two arguments.
In the InlineRule for myMap we'll have the unfolding
    (\d -> genMap Int (..d..))
We do not want to eta-expand to
    (\d f xs -> genMap Int (..d..) f xs)
because then 'genMap' will inline, and it really shouldn't: at least
as far as the programmer is concerned, it's not applied to two
arguments!

Note [Floating and type abstraction]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this:
        x = /\a. C e1 e2
We'd like to float this to
        y1 = /\a. e1
        y2 = /\a. e2
        x  = /\a. C (y1 a) (y2 a)
for the usual reasons: we want to inline x rather vigorously.

You may think that this kind of thing is rare.  But in some programs it is
common.  For example, if you do closure conversion you might get:

        data a :-> b = forall e. (e -> a -> b) :$ e

        f_cc :: forall a. a :-> a
        f_cc = /\a. (\e. id a) :$ ()

Now we really want to inline that f_cc thing so that the
construction of the closure goes away.

So I have elaborated simplLazyBind to understand right-hand sides that look
like
        /\ a1..an. body

and treat them specially. The real work is done in SimplUtils.abstractFloats,
but there is quite a bit of plumbing in simplLazyBind as well.

The same transformation is good when there are lets in the body:

        /\abc -> let(rec) x = e in b
   ==>
        let(rec) x' = /\abc -> let x = x' a b c in e
        in
        /\abc -> let x = x' a b c in b

This is good because it can turn things like:

        let f = /\a -> letrec g = ... g ... in g
into
        letrec g' = /\a -> ... g' a ...
        in
        let f = /\ a -> g' a

which is better.  In effect, it means that big lambdas don't impede
let-floating.

This optimisation is CRUCIAL in eliminating the junk introduced by
desugaring mutually recursive definitions.  Don't eliminate it lightly!

[May 1999]  If we do this transformation *regardless* then we can
end up with some pretty silly stuff.  For example,

        let
            st = /\ s -> let { x1=r1 ; x2=r2 } in ...
        in ..
becomes
        let y1 = /\s -> r1
            y2 = /\s -> r2
            st = /\s -> ...[y1 s/x1, y2 s/x2]
        in ..

Unless the "..." is a WHNF there is really no point in doing this.
Indeed it can make things worse.  Suppose x1 is used strictly,
and is of the form

        x1* = case f y of { (a,b) -> e }

If we abstract this wrt the tyvar we then can't do the case inline
as we would normally do.

That's why the whole transformation is part of the same process that
floats let-bindings and constructor arguments out of RHSs.  In particular,
it is guarded by the doFloatFromRhs call in simplLazyBind.

Note [Abstract over coercions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a coercion variable (g :: a ~ Int) is free in the RHS, then so is the
type variable a.  Rather than sort this mess out, we simply bale out and abstract
wrt all the type variables if any of them are coercion variables.


Historical note: if you use let-bindings instead of a substitution, beware of this:

                -- Suppose we start with:
                --
                --      x = /\ a -> let g = G in E

                -- Then we'll float to get
                --

                --          in /\ a -> let g = poly_g a in E
                --
                -- But now the occurrence analyser will see just one occurrence

                -- (I used to think that the "don't inline lone occurrences" stuff
                --  would stop this happening, but since it's the *only* occurrence,

                --

prepareAlts tries these things:

1.  Eliminate alternatives that cannot match, including the
    DEFAULT alternative.

2.  If the DEFAULT alternative can match only one possible constructor,
    then make that constructor explicit.
    e.g.
        case e of x { DEFAULT -> rhs }
     ===>
        case e of x { (a,b) -> rhs }
    where the type is a single constructor type.  This gives better code
    when rhs also scrutinises x or e.

3. Returns a list of the constructors that cannot holds in the
   DEFAULT alternative (if there is one)

Here "cannot match" includes knowledge from GADTs

It's a good idea to do this stuff before simplifying the alternatives, to
avoid simplifying alternatives we know can't happen, and to come up with
the list of constructors that are handled, to put into the IdInfo of the
case binder, for use when simplifying the alternatives.

Eliminating the default alternative in (1) isn't so obvious, but it can
happen:

data Colour = Red | Green | Blue

f x = case x of
        Red -> ..
        Green -> ..
        DEFAULT -> h x

h y = case y of
        Blue -> ..
        DEFAULT -> [ case y of ... ]

If we inline h into f, the default case of the inlined h can't happen.
If we don't notice this, we may end up filtering out *all* the cases
of the inner case y, which give us nowhere to go!

\begin{code}
prepareAlts :: OutExpr -> OutId -> [InAlt] -> SimplM ([AltCon], [InAlt])
-- The returned alternatives can be empty, none are possible
prepareAlts scrut case_bndr' alts
           -- Case binder is needed just for its type. Note that as an
           --   OutId, it has maximum information; this is important.
           --   Test simpl013 is an example
  = do { us <- getUniquesM
       ; let (imposs_deflt_cons, refined_deflt, alts') 
                = filterAlts us (varType case_bndr') imposs_cons alts
       ; when refined_deflt $ tick (FillInCaseDefault case_bndr')
 
       ; alts'' <- combineIdenticalAlts case_bndr' alts'
       ; return (imposs_deflt_cons, alts'') }
  where
    imposs_cons = case scrut of
                    Var v -> otherCons (idUnfolding v)
                    _     -> []
\end{code}

Note [Combine identical alternatives]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If several alternatives are identical, merge them into
 a single DEFAULT alternative.  I've occasionally seen this
 making a big difference:

     case e of               =====>     case e of
       C _ -> f x                         D v -> ....v....
       D v -> ....v....                   DEFAULT -> f x
       DEFAULT -> f x

The point is that we merge common RHSs, at least for the DEFAULT case.
[One could do something more elaborate but I've never seen it needed.]
To avoid an expensive test, we just merge branches equal to the *first*
alternative; this picks up the common cases
     a) all branches equal
     b) some branches equal to the DEFAULT (which occurs first)

The case where Combine Identical Alternatives transformation showed up
was like this (base/Foreign/C/Err/Error.lhs):

        x | p `is` 1 -> e1
          | p `is` 2 -> e2
        ...etc...

where @is@ was something like

        p `is` n = p /= (-1) && p == n

This gave rise to a horrible sequence of cases

        case p of
          (-1) -> $j p
          1    -> e1
          DEFAULT -> $j p

and similarly in cascade for all the join points!

NB: it's important that all this is done in [InAlt], *before* we work
on the alternatives themselves, because Simpify.simplAlt may zap the
occurrence info on the binders in the alternatives, which in turn
defeats combineIdenticalAlts (see Trac #7360).

\begin{code}
combineIdenticalAlts :: OutId -> [InAlt] -> SimplM [InAlt]
-- See Note [Combine identical alternatives]
combineIdenticalAlts case_bndr ((_con1,bndrs1,rhs1) : con_alts)
  | all isDeadBinder bndrs1                     -- Remember the default
  , length filtered_alts < length con_alts      -- alternative comes first
  = do  { tick (AltMerge case_bndr)
        ; return ((DEFAULT, [], rhs1) : filtered_alts) }
  where
    filtered_alts = filterOut identical_to_alt1 con_alts
    identical_to_alt1 (_con,bndrs,rhs) = all isDeadBinder bndrs && rhs `cheapEqExpr` rhs1

combineIdenticalAlts _ alts = return alts
\end{code}

mkCase tries these things

1.  Merge Nested Cases

       case e of b {             ==>   case e of b {
         p1 -> rhs1                      p1 -> rhs1
         ...                             ...
         pm -> rhsm                      pm -> rhsm
         _  -> case b of b' {            pn -> let b'=b in rhsn
                     pn -> rhsn          ...
                     ...                 po -> let b'=b in rhso
                     po -> rhso          _  -> let b'=b in rhsd
                     _  -> rhsd
       }

    which merges two cases in one case when -- the default alternative of
    the outer case scrutises the same variable as the outer case. This
    transformation is called Case Merging.  It avoids that the same
    variable is scrutinised multiple times.

2.  Eliminate Identity Case

        case e of               ===> e
                True  -> True;
                False -> False

    and similar friends.

Note [Dead binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that dead-ness is maintained by the simplifier, so that it is
accurate after simplification as well as before.


Note [Cascading case merge]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Case merging should cascade in one sweep, because it
happens bottom-up

      case e of a {
        DEFAULT -> case a of b
                      DEFAULT -> case b of c {
                                     DEFAULT -> e
                                     A -> ea
                      B -> eb
        C -> ec
==>
      case e of a {
        DEFAULT -> case a of b
                      DEFAULT -> let c = b in e
                      A -> let c = b in ea
                      B -> eb
        C -> ec
==>
      case e of a {
        DEFAULT -> let b = a in let c = b in e
        A -> let b = a in let c = b in ea
        B -> let b = a in eb
        C -> ec


However here's a tricky case that we still don't catch, and I don't
see how to catch it in one pass:

  case x of c1 { I# a1 ->
  case a1 of c2 ->
    0 -> ...
    DEFAULT -> case x of c3 { I# a2 ->
               case a2 of ...

After occurrence analysis (and its binder-swap) we get this

  case x of c1 { I# a1 ->
  let x = c1 in         -- Binder-swap addition
  case a1 of c2 ->
    0 -> ...
    DEFAULT -> case x of c3 { I# a2 ->
               case a2 of ...

When we simplify the inner case x, we'll see that
x=c1=I# a1.  So we'll bind a2 to a1, and get

  case x of c1 { I# a1 ->
  case a1 of c2 ->
    0 -> ...
    DEFAULT -> case a1 of ...

This is corect, but we can't do a case merge in this sweep
because c2 /= a1.  Reason: the binding c1=I# a1 went inwards
without getting changed to c1=I# c2.

I don't think this is worth fixing, even if I knew how. It'll
all come out in the next pass anyway.
