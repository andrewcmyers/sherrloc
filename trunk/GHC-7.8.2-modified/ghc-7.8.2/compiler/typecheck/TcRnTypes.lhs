Various types used during typechecking, please see TcRnMonad as well for
operations on these types. You probably want to import it, instead of this
module.

All the monads exported here are built on top of the same IOEnv monad. The
monad functions like a Reader monad in the way it passes the environment
around. This is done to allow the environment to be manipulated in a stack
like fashion when entering expressions... ect.

For state that is global and should be returned at the end (e.g not part
of the stack mechanism), you should use an TcRef (= IORef) to store them.

\begin{code}

Note [Tracking unused binding and imports]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We gather two sorts of usage information
 * tcg_dus (defs/uses)
      Records *defined* Names (local, top-level)
          and *used*    Names (local or imported)

      Used (a) to report "defined but not used"
               (see RnNames.reportUnusedNames)
           (b) to generate version-tracking usage info in interface
               files (see MkIface.mkUsedNames)
   This usage info is mainly gathered by the renamer's
   gathering of free-variables

 * tcg_used_rdrnames
      Records used *imported* (not locally-defined) RdrNames
      Used only to report unused import declarations
      Notice that they are RdrNames, not Names, so we can
      tell whether the reference was qualified or unqualified, which
      is esssential in deciding whether a particular import decl
      is unnecessary.  This info isn't present in Names.

The Global-Env/Local-Env story
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During type checking, we keep in the tcg_type_env
        * All types and classes
        * All Ids derived from types and classes (constructors, selectors)

At the end of type checking, we zonk the local bindings,
and as we do so we add to the tcg_type_env
        * Locally defined top-level Ids

Why?  Because they are now Ids not TcIds.  This final GlobalEnv is
        a) fed back (via the knot) to typechecking the
           unfoldings of interface signatures
        b) used in the ModDetails of this module

                        -- Discarded after typecheck/rename; not passed on to desugarer

{- Note [Given Insts]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because of GADTs, we have to pass inwards the Insts provided by type signatures
and existential contexts. Consider
        data T a where { T1 :: b -> b -> T [b] }
        f :: Eq a => T a -> Bool
        f (T1 x y) = [x]==[y]

The constructor T1 binds an existential variable 'b', and we need Eq [b].
Well, we have it, because Eq a refines to Eq [b], but we can only spot that if we
pass it inwards.

-- Arrow-notation context
---------------------------

{- Note [Escaping the arrow scope]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In arrow notation, a variable bound by a proc (or enclosed let/kappa)
is not in scope to the left of an arrow tail (-<) or the head of (|..|).
For example

        proc x -> (e1 -< e2)

Here, x is not in scope in e1, but it is in scope in e2.  This can get
a bit complicated:

        let x = 3 in
        proc y -> (proc z -> e1) -< e2

Here, x and z are in scope in e1, but y is not.

We implement this by
recording the environment when passing a proc (using newArrowScope),
and returning to that (using escapeArrowScope) on the left of -< and the
head of (|..|).

All this can be dealt with by the *renamer*; by the time we get to
the *type checker* we have sorted out the scopes

Note [Bindings with closed types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider

  f x = let g ys = map not ys
        in ...

Can we generalise 'g' under the OutsideIn algorithm?  Yes,
because all g's free variables are top-level; that is they themselves
have no free type variables, and it is the type variables in the
environment that makes things tricky for OutsideIn generalisation.

Definition:

   A variable is "closed", and has tct_closed set to TopLevel,
      iff
   a) all its free variables are imported, or are themselves closed
   b) generalisation is not restricted by the monomorphism restriction

Under OutsideIn we are free to generalise a closed let-binding.
This is an extension compared to the JFP paper on OutsideIn, which
used "top-level" as a proxy for "closed".  (It's not a good proxy
anyway -- the MR can make a top-level binding with a free type
variable.)

Note that:
  * A top-level binding may not be closed, if it suffer from the MR

  * A nested binding may be closed (eg 'g' in the example we started with)
    Indeed, that's the point; whether a function is defined at top level
    or nested is orthogonal to the question of whether or not it is closed

  * A binding may be non-closed because it mentions a lexically scoped
    *type variable*  Eg
        f :: forall a. blah
        f x = let g y = ...(y::a)...


\begin{code}
type ErrCtxt = (Bool, TidyEnv -> TcM (TidyEnv, MsgDoc))
        -- Monadic so that we have a chance
        -- to deal with bound type variables just before error
        -- message construction

        -- Bool:  True <=> this is a landmark context; do not
        --                 discard it when trimming for display

Note [Kind orientation for CTyEqCan]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Given an equality  (t:* ~ s:Open), we absolutely want to re-orient it.
We can't solve it by updating t:=s, ragardless of how touchable 't' is,
because the kinds don't work.  Indeed we don't want to leave it with
the orientation (t ~ s), because if that gets into the inert set we'll
start replacing t's by s's, and that too is the wrong way round.

Hence in a CTyEqCan, (t:k1 ~ xi:k2) we require that k2 is a subkind of k1.

If the two have incompatible kinds, we just don't use a CTyEqCan at all.
See Note [Equalities with incompatible kinds] in TcCanonical

We can't require *equal* kinds, because
     * wanted constraints don't necessarily have identical kinds
               eg   alpha::? ~ Int
     * a solved wanted constraint becomes a given

Note [Kind orientation for CFunEqCan]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For (F xis ~ rhs) we require that kind(lhs) is a subkind of kind(rhs).
This reallly only maters when rhs is an Open type variable (since only type
variables have Open kinds):
   F ty ~ (a:Open)
which can happen, say, from
      f :: F a b
      f = undefined   -- The a:Open comes from instantiating 'undefined'

Note that the kind invariant is maintained by rewriting.
Eg wanted1 rewrites wanted2; if both were compatible kinds before,
   wanted2 will be afterwards.  Similarly givens.

Caveat:
  - Givens from higher-rank, such as:
          type family T b :: * -> * -> *
          type instance T Bool = (->)

          f :: forall a. ((T a ~ (->)) => ...) -> a -> ...
          flop = f (...) True
     Whereas we would be able to apply the type instance, we would not be able to
     use the given (T Bool ~ (->)) in the body of 'flop'


Note [CIrredEvCan constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CIrredEvCan constraints are used for constraints that are "stuck"
   - we can't solve them (yet)
   - we can't use them to solve other constraints
   - but they may become soluble if we substitute for some
     of the type variables in the constraint

Example 1:  (c Int), where c :: * -> Constraint.  We can't do anything
            with this yet, but if later c := Num, *then* we can solve it

Example 2:  a ~ b, where a :: *, b :: k, where k is a kind variable
            We don't want to use this to substitute 'b' for 'a', in case
            'k' is subequently unifed with (say) *->*, because then
            we'd have ill-kinded types floating about.  Rather we want
            to defer using the equality altogether until 'k' get resolved.

Note [Ct/evidence invariant]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  ct :: Ct, then extra fields of 'ct' cache precisely the ctev_pred field
of (cc_ev ct), and is fully rewritten wrt the substitution.   Eg for CDictCan,
   ctev_pred (cc_ev ct) = (cc_class ct) (cc_tyargs ct)
This holds by construction; look at the unique place where CDictCan is
built (in TcCanonical).

In contrast, the type of the evidence *term* (ccev_evtm or ctev_evar) in
the evidence may *not* be fully zonked; we are careful not to look at it
during constraint solving.  See Note [Evidence field of CtEvidence]

\begin{code}
mkNonCanonical :: CtEvidence -> Ct
mkNonCanonical ev = CNonCanonical { cc_ev = ev }

mkNonCanonicalCt :: Ct -> Ct
mkNonCanonicalCt ct = CNonCanonical { cc_ev = cc_ev ct }

ctEvidence :: Ct -> CtEvidence
ctEvidence = cc_ev

ctLoc :: Ct -> CtLoc
ctLoc = ctev_loc . cc_ev

ctPred :: Ct -> PredType
-- See Note [Ct/evidence invariant]
ctPred ct = ctEvPred (cc_ev ct)

dropDerivedWC :: WantedConstraints -> WantedConstraints
-- See Note [Dropping derived constraints]
dropDerivedWC wc@(WC { wc_flat = flats, wc_insol = insols })
  = wc { wc_flat  = filterBag isWantedCt          flats
       , wc_insol = filterBag (not . isDerivedCt) insols  }
    -- Keep Givens from insols because they indicate unreachable code
    -- The implications are (recursively) already filtered
\end{code}

Note [Dropping derived constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In general we discard derived constraints at the end of constraint solving;
see dropDerivedWC.  A consequence is that
   we never report an error for a derived constraint,
   and hence we do not need to take much care with their CtLoc

For example,

 * If we have an unsolved (Ord a), we don't want to complain about
   an unsolved (Eq a) as well.
 * If we have kind-incompatible (a::* ~ Int#::#) equality, we
   don't want to complain about the kind error twice.

Arguably, for *some* derived constraints we might want to report errors.
Notably, functional dependencies.  If we have
    class C a b | a -> b
and we have
    [W] C a b, [W] C a c
where a,b,c are all signature variables.  Then we could imagine
reporting an error unifying (b ~ c). But it's better to report that we can't
solve (C a b) and (C a c) since those arose directly from something the
programmer wrote.

Note [Shadowing in a constraint]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We assume NO SHADOWING in a constraint.  Specifically
 * The unification variables are all implicitly quantified at top
   level, and are all unique
 * The skolem varibles bound in ic_skols are all freah when the
   implication is created.
So we can safely substitute. For example, if we have
   forall a.  a~Int => ...(forall b. ...a...)...
we can push the (a~Int) constraint inwards in the "givens" without
worrying that 'b' might clash.

Note [Skolems in an implication]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The skolems in an implication are not there to perform a skolem escape
check.  That happens because all the environment variables are in the
untouchables, and therefore cannot be unified with anything at all,
let alone the skolems.

Instead, ic_skols is used only when considering floating a constraint
outside the implication in TcSimplify.floatEqualities or
TcSimplify.approximateImplications

Note [Insoluble constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some of the errors that we get during canonicalization are best
reported when all constraints have been simplified as much as
possible. For instance, assume that during simplification the
following constraints arise:

 [Wanted]   F alpha ~  uf1
 [Wanted]   beta ~ uf1 beta

When canonicalizing the wanted (beta ~ uf1 beta), if we eagerly fail
we will simply see a message:
    'Can't construct the infinite type  beta ~ uf1 beta'
and the user has no idea what the uf1 variable is.

Instead our plan is that we will NOT fail immediately, but:
    (1) Record the "frozen" error in the ic_insols field
    (2) Isolate the offending constraint from the rest of the inerts
    (3) Keep on simplifying/canonicalizing

At the end, we will hopefully have substituted uf1 := F alpha, and we
will be able to report a more informative error:
    'Can't construct the infinite type beta ~ F alpha beta'

Insoluble constraints *do* include Derived constraints. For example,
a functional dependency might give rise to [D] Int ~ Bool, and we must
report that.  If insolubles did not contain Deriveds, reportErrors would
never see it.

See Note [canRewrite and canRewriteOrSame]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(canRewrite ct1 ct2) holds if the constraint ct1 can be used to solve ct2.
"To solve" means a reaction where the active parts of the two constraints match.
   active(F xis ~ xi) = F xis
   active(tv ~ xi)    = tv
   active(D xis)      = D xis
   active(IP nm ty)   = nm

At the moment we don't allow Wanteds to rewrite Wanteds, because that can give
rise to very confusing type error messages.  A good example is Trac #8450.
Here's another
   f :: a -> Bool
   f x = ( [x,'c'], [x,True] ) `seq` True
Here we get
  [W] a ~ Char
  [W] a ~ Bool
but we do not want to complain about Bool ~ Char!

NB:  either (a `canRewrite` b) or (b `canRewrite` a)
         or a==b
     must hold

canRewriteOrSame is similar but returns True for Wanted/Wanted.
See the call sites for explanations.

Note [SubGoalDepth]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'SubGoalCounter' takes care of stopping the constraint solver from looping.
Because of the different use-cases of regular constaints and type function
applications, there are two independent counters. Therefore, this datatype is
abstract. See Note [WorkList]

Each counter starts at zero and increases.

* The "dictionary constraint counter" counts the depth of type class
  instance declarations.  Example:
     [W] d{7} : Eq [Int]
  That is d's dictionary-constraint depth is 7.  If we use the instance
     $dfEqList :: Eq a => Eq [a]
  to simplify it, we get
     d{7} = $dfEqList d'{8}
  where d'{8} : Eq Int, and d' has dictionary-constraint depth 8.

  For civilised (decidable) instance declarations, each increase of
  depth removes a type constructor from the type, so the depth never
  gets big; i.e. is bounded by the structural depth of the type.

  The flag -fcontext-stack=n (not very well named!) fixes the maximium
  level.

* The "type function reduction counter" does the same thing when resolving
* qualities involving type functions. Example:
  Assume we have a wanted at depth 7:
    [W] d{7} : F () ~ a
  If thre is an type function equation "F () = Int", this would be rewritten to
    [W] d{8} : Int ~ a
  and remembered as having depth 8.

  Again, without UndecidableInstances, this counter is bounded, but without it
  can resolve things ad infinitum. Hence there is a maximum level. But we use a
  different maximum, as we expect possibly many more type function reductions
  in sensible programs than type class constraints.

  The flag -ftype-function-depth=n fixes the maximium level.

\begin{code}
data SubGoalCounter = CountConstraints | CountTyFunApps

data SubGoalDepth  -- See Note [SubGoalDepth]
   = SubGoalDepth
         {-# UNPACK #-} !Int      -- Dictionary constraints
         {-# UNPACK #-} !Int      -- Type function reductions
  deriving (Eq, Ord)

instance Outputable SubGoalDepth where
 ppr (SubGoalDepth c f) =  angleBrackets $
        char 'C' <> colon <> int c <> comma <>
        char 'F' <> colon <> int f

initialSubGoalDepth :: SubGoalDepth
initialSubGoalDepth = SubGoalDepth 0 0

maxSubGoalDepth :: DynFlags -> SubGoalDepth
maxSubGoalDepth dflags = SubGoalDepth (ctxtStkDepth dflags) (tyFunStkDepth dflags)

bumpSubGoalDepth :: SubGoalCounter -> SubGoalDepth -> SubGoalDepth
bumpSubGoalDepth CountConstraints (SubGoalDepth c f) = SubGoalDepth (c+1) f
bumpSubGoalDepth CountTyFunApps   (SubGoalDepth c f) = SubGoalDepth c (f+1)

subGoalCounterValue :: SubGoalCounter -> SubGoalDepth -> Int
subGoalCounterValue CountConstraints (SubGoalDepth c _) = c
subGoalCounterValue CountTyFunApps   (SubGoalDepth _ f) = f

subGoalDepthExceeded :: SubGoalDepth -> SubGoalDepth -> Maybe SubGoalCounter
subGoalDepthExceeded (SubGoalDepth mc mf) (SubGoalDepth c f)
        | c > mc    = Just CountConstraints
        | f > mf    = Just CountTyFunApps
        | otherwise = Nothing
\end{code}

Note [Preventing recursive dictionaries]

We have some classes where it is not very useful to build recursive
dictionaries (Coercible, at the moment). So we need the constraint solver to
prevent that. We conservatively ensure this property using the subgoal depth of
the constraints: When solving a Coercible constraint at depth d, we do not
consider evidence from a depth <= d as suitable.

Therefore we need to record the minimum depth allowed to solve a CtWanted. This
is done in the SubGoalDepth field of CtWanted. Most code now uses mkCtWanted,
which initializes it to initialSubGoalDepth (i.e. 0); but when requesting a
Coercible instance (requestCoercible in TcInteract), we bump the current depth
by one and use that.

There are two spots where wanted contraints attempted to be solved using
existing constraints; doTopReactDict in TcInteract (in the general solver) and
newWantedEvVarNonrec (only used by requestCoercible) in TcSMonad. Both use
ctEvCheckDepth to make the check. That function ensures that a Given constraint
can always be used to solve a goal (i.e. they are at depth infinity, for our
purposes)
