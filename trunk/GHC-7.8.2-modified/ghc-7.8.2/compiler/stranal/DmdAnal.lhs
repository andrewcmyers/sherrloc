Note [Ensure demand is strict]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's important not to analyse e with a lazy demand because
a) When we encounter   case s of (a,b) -> 
	we demand s with U(d1d2)... but if the overall demand is lazy
	that is wrong, and we'd need to reduce the demand on s,
	which is inconvenient
b) More important, consider
	f (let x = R in x+x), where f is lazy
   We still want to mark x as demanded, because it will be when we
   enter the let.  If we analyse f's arg with a Lazy demand, we'll
   just mark x as Lazy
c) The application rule wouldn't be right either
   Evaluating (f x) in a L demand does *not* cause
   evaluation of f in a C(L) demand!

\end{code}

Note [Aggregated demand for cardinality]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We use different strategies for strictness and usage/cardinality to
"unleash" demands captured on free variables by bindings. Let us
consider the example:

f1 y = let {-# NOINLINE h #-}
           h = y
       in  (h, h)

We are interested in obtaining cardinality demand U1 on |y|, as it is
used only in a thunk, and, therefore, is not going to be updated any
more. Therefore, the demand on |y|, captured and unleashed by usage of
|h| is U1. However, if we unleash this demand every time |h| is used,
and then sum up the effects, the ultimate demand on |y| will be U1 +
U1 = U. In order to avoid it, we *first* collect the aggregate demand
on |h| in the body of let-expression, and only then apply the demand
transformer:

transf[x](U) = {y |-> U1}

so the resulting demand on |y| is U1. 

The situation is, however, different for strictness, where this
aggregating approach exhibits worse results because of the nature of
|both| operation for strictness. Consider the example:

f y c = 
  let h x = y |seq| x
   in case of 
        True  -> h True
        False -> y

It is clear that |f| is strict in |y|, however, the suggested analysis
will infer from the body of |let| that |h| is used lazily (as it is
used in one branch only), therefore lazy demand will be put on its
free variable |y|. Conversely, if the demand on |h| is unleashed right
on the spot, we will get the desired result, namely, that |f| is
strict in |y|.

Note [Annotating lambdas at right-hand side]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let us take a look at the following example:

g f = let x = 100
          h = \y -> f x y
       in h 5

One can see that |h| is called just once, therefore the RHS of h can
be annotated as a one-shot lambda. This is done by the function
annLamWithShotness *a posteriori*, i.e., basing on the aggregated
usage demand on |h| from the body of |let|-expression, which is C1(U)
in this case.

In other words, for locally-bound lambdas we can infer
one-shotness. 

\begin{code}
addDataConPatDmds :: AltCon -> [Var] -> DmdType -> DmdType
-- See Note [Add demands for strict constructors]
addDataConPatDmds DEFAULT    _ dmd_ty = dmd_ty
addDataConPatDmds (LitAlt _) _ dmd_ty = dmd_ty
addDataConPatDmds (DataAlt con) bndrs dmd_ty
  = foldr add dmd_ty str_bndrs 
  where
    add bndr dmd_ty = addVarDmd dmd_ty bndr seqDmd
    str_bndrs = [ b | (b,s) <- zipEqual "addDataConPatBndrs"
                                   (filter isId bndrs)
                                   (dataConRepStrictness con)
                    , isMarkedStrict s ]
\end{code}

Note [Add demands for strict constructors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this program (due to Roman):

    data X a = X !a

    foo :: X Int -> Int -> Int
    foo (X a) n = go 0
     where
       go i | i < n     = a + go (i+1)
            | otherwise = 0

We want the worker for 'foo' too look like this:

    $wfoo :: Int# -> Int# -> Int#

with the first argument unboxed, so that it is not eval'd each time
around the loop (which would otherwise happen, since 'foo' is not
strict in 'a'.  It is sound for the wrapper to pass an unboxed arg
because X is strict, so its argument must be evaluated.  And if we
*don't* pass an unboxed argument, we can't even repair it by adding a
`seq` thus:

    foo (X a) n = a `seq` go 0

because the seq is discarded (very early) since X is strict!

There is the usual danger of reboxing, which as usual we ignore. But 
if X is monomorphic, and has an UNPACK pragma, then this optimisation
is even more important.  We don't want the wrapper to rebox an unboxed
argument, and pass an Int to $wfoo!

Note [Trivial right-hand sides]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
	foo = plusInt |> co
where plusInt is an arity-2 function with known strictness.  Clearly
we want plusInt's strictness to propagate to foo!  But because it has
no manifest lambdas, it won't do so automatically.  So we have a 
special case for right-hand sides that are "trivial", namely variables,
casts, type applications, and the like. 

Note [Product demands for function body]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example comes from shootout/binary_trees:

    Main.check' = \ b z ds. case z of z' { I# ip ->
        			case ds_d13s of
        			  Main.Nil -> z'
        			  Main.Node s14k s14l s14m ->
        			    Main.check' (not b)
        			      (Main.check' b
        			         (case b {
        			            False -> I# (-# s14h s14k);
        			            True  -> I# (+# s14h s14k)
        			          })
        			         s14l)
        			     s14m   }   }   }

Here we *really* want to unbox z, even though it appears to be used boxed in
the Nil case.  Partly the Nil case is not a hot path.  But more specifically,
the whole function gets the CPR property if we do. 

So for the demand on the body of a RHS we use a product demand if it's
a product type.

Note [CPR for sum types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the moment we do not do CPR for let-bindings that
   * non-top level
   * bind a sum type
Reason: I found that in some benchmarks we were losing let-no-escapes,
which messed it all up.  Example
   let j = \x. ....
   in case y of
        True  -> j False
        False -> j True
If we w/w this we get
   let j' = \x. ....
   in case y of
        True  -> case j' False of { (# a #) -> Just a }
        False -> case j' True of { (# a #) -> Just a }
Notice that j' is not a let-no-escape any more.

However this means in turn that the *enclosing* function
may be CPR'd (via the returned Justs).  But in the case of
sums, there may be Nothing alternatives; and that messes
up the sum-type CPR.

Conclusion: only do this for products.  It's still not
guaranteed OK for products, but sums definitely lose sometimes.

Note [CPR for thunks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the rhs is a thunk, we usually forget the CPR info, because
it is presumably shared (else it would have been inlined, and 
so we'd lose sharing if w/w'd it into a function).  E.g.

	let r = case expensive of
		  (a,b) -> (b,a)
	in ...

If we marked r as having the CPR property, then we'd w/w into

	let $wr = \() -> case expensive of
			    (a,b) -> (# b, a #)
	    r = case $wr () of
		  (# b,a #) -> (b,a)
	in ...

But now r is a thunk, which won't be inlined, so we are no further ahead.
But consider

	f x = let r = case expensive of (a,b) -> (b,a)
	      in if foo r then r else (x,x)

Does f have the CPR property?  Well, no.

However, if the strictness analyser has figured out (in a previous 
iteration) that it's strict, then we DON'T need to forget the CPR info.
Instead we can retain the CPR info and do the thunk-splitting transform 
(see WorkWrap.splitThunk).

This made a big difference to PrelBase.modInt, which had something like
	modInt = \ x -> let r = ... -> I# v in
			...body strict in r...
r's RHS isn't a value yet; but modInt returns r in various branches, so
if r doesn't have the CPR property then neither does modInt
Another case I found in practice (in Complex.magnitude), looks like this:
		let k = if ... then I# a else I# b
		in ... body strict in k ....
(For this example, it doesn't matter whether k is returned as part of
the overall result; but it does matter that k's RHS has the CPR property.)  
Left to itself, the simplifier will make a join point thus:
		let $j k = ...body strict in k...
		if ... then $j (I# a) else $j (I# b)
With thunk-splitting, we get instead
		let $j x = let k = I#x in ...body strict in k...
		in if ... then $j a else $j b
This is much better; there's a good chance the I# won't get allocated.

The difficulty with this is that we need the strictness type to
look at the body... but we now need the body to calculate the demand
on the variable, so we can decide whether its strictness type should
have a CPR in it or not.  Simple solution: 
	a) use strictness info from the previous iteration
	b) make sure we do at least 2 iterations, by doing a second
	   round for top-level non-recs.  Top level recs will get at
	   least 2 iterations except for totally-bottom functions
	   which aren't very interesting anyway.

NB: strictly_demanded is never true of a top-level Id, or of a recursive Id.

Note [Optimistic CPR in the "virgin" case]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Demand and strictness info are initialized by top elements. However,
this prevents from inferring a CPR property in the first pass of the
analyser, so we keep an explicit flag ae_virgin in the AnalEnv
datatype.

We can't start with 'not-demanded' (i.e., top) because then consider
	f x = let 
		  t = ... I# x
	      in
	      if ... then t else I# y else f x'

In the first iteration we'd have no demand info for x, so assume
not-demanded; then we'd get TopRes for f's CPR info.  Next iteration
we'd see that t was demanded, and so give it the CPR property, but by
now f has TopRes, so it will stay TopRes.  Instead, by checking the
ae_virgin flag at the first time round, we say 'yes t is demanded' the
first time.

However, this does mean that for non-recursive bindings we must
iterate twice to be sure of not getting over-optimistic CPR info,
in the case where t turns out to be not-demanded.  This is handled
by dmdAnalTopBind.


Note [NOINLINE and strictness]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The strictness analyser used to have a HACK which ensured that NOINLNE
things were not strictness-analysed.  The reason was unsafePerformIO. 
Left to itself, the strictness analyser would discover this strictness 
for unsafePerformIO:
	unsafePerformIO:  C(U(AV))
But then consider this sub-expression
	unsafePerformIO (\s -> let r = f x in 
			       case writeIORef v r s of (# s1, _ #) ->
			       (# s1, r #)
The strictness analyser will now find that r is sure to be eval'd,
and may then hoist it out.  This makes tests/lib/should_run/memo002
deadlock.

Solving this by making all NOINLINE things have no strictness info is overkill.
In particular, it's overkill for runST, which is perfectly respectable.
Consider
	f x = runST (return x)
This should be strict in x.

So the new plan is to define unsafePerformIO using the 'lazy' combinator:

	unsafePerformIO (IO m) = lazy (case m realWorld# of (# _, r #) -> r)

Remember, 'lazy' is a wired-in identity-function Id, of type a->a, which is 
magically NON-STRICT, and is inlined after strictness analysis.  So
unsafePerformIO will look non-strict, and that's what we want.

Now we don't need the hack in the strictness analyser.  HOWEVER, this
decision does mean that even a NOINLINE function is not entirely
opaque: some aspect of its implementation leaks out, notably its
strictness.  For example, if you have a function implemented by an
error stub, but which has RULES, you may want it not to be eliminated
in favour of error!

Note [Lazy and unleasheable free variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We put the strict and once-used FVs in the DmdType of the Id, so 
that at its call sites we unleash demands on its strict fvs.
An example is 'roll' in imaginary/wheel-sieve2
Something like this:
	roll x = letrec 
		     go y = if ... then roll (x-1) else x+1
		 in 
		 go ms
We want to see that roll is strict in x, which is because
go is called.   So we put the DmdEnv for x in go's DmdType.

Another example:

	f :: Int -> Int -> Int
	f x y = let t = x+1
	    h z = if z==0 then t else 
		  if z==1 then x+1 else
		  x + h (z-1)
	in h y

Calling h does indeed evaluate x, but we can only see
that if we unleash a demand on x at the call site for t.

Incidentally, here's a place where lambda-lifting h would
lose the cigar --- we couldn't see the joint strictness in t/x

	ON THE OTHER HAND
We don't want to put *all* the fv's from the RHS into the
DmdType, because that makes fixpointing very slow --- the 
DmdType gets full of lazy demands that are slow to converge.


Note [Lamba-bound unfoldings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We allow a lambda-bound variable to carry an unfolding, a facility that is used
exclusively for join points; see Note [Case binders and join points].  If so,
we must be careful to demand-analyse the RHS of the unfolding!  Example
   \x. \y{=Just x}. <body>
Then if <body> uses 'y', then transitively it uses 'x', and we must not
forget that fact, otherwise we might make 'x' absent when it isn't.

Note [Initial CPR for strict binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CPR is initialized for a lambda binder in an optimistic manner, i.e,
if the binder is used strictly and at least some of its components as
a product are used, which is checked by the value of the absence
demand.

If the binder is marked demanded with a strict demand, then give it a
CPR signature, because in the likely event that this is a lambda on a
fn defn [we only use this when the lambda is being consumed with a
call demand], it'll be w/w'd and so it will be CPR-ish.  E.g.

	f = \x::(Int,Int).  if ...strict in x... then
				x
			    else
				(a,b)
We want f to have the CPR property because x does, by the time f has been w/w'd

Also note that we only want to do this for something that definitely
has product type, else we may get over-optimistic CPR results
(e.g. from \x -> x!).


Note [Initialising strictness]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See section 9.2 (Finding fixpoints) of the paper.

Our basic plan is to initialise the strictness of each Id in a
recursive group to "bottom", and find a fixpoint from there.  However,
this group B might be inside an *enclosing* recursiveb group A, in
which case we'll do the entire fixpoint shebang on for each iteration
of A. This can be illustrated by the following example:

Example:

  f [] = []
  f (x:xs) = let g []     = f xs
                 g (y:ys) = y+1 : g ys
              in g (h x)

At each iteration of the fixpoint for f, the analyser has to find a
fixpoint for the enclosed function g. In the meantime, the demand
values for g at each iteration for f are *greater* than those we
encountered in the previous iteration for f. Therefore, we can begin
the fixpoint for g not with the bottom value but rather with the
result of the previous analysis. I.e., when beginning the fixpoint
process for g, we can start from the demand signature computed for g
previously and attached to the binding occurrence of g.

To speed things up, we initialise each iteration of A (the enclosing
one) from the result of the last one, which is neatly recorded in each
binder.  That way we make use of earlier iterations of the fixpoint
algorithm. (Cunning plan.)

But on the *first* iteration we want to *ignore* the current strictness
of the Id, and start from "bottom".  Nowadays the Id can have a current
strictness, because interface files record strictness for nested bindings.
To know when we are in the first iteration, we look at the ae_virgin
field of the AnalEnv.
