Note [Template tyvars are fresh]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The is_tvs field of a ClsInst has *completely fresh* tyvars.  
That is, they are
  * distinct from any other ClsInst
  * distinct from any tyvars free in predicates that may
    be looked up in the class instance environment
Reason for freshness: we use unification when checking for overlap
etc, and that requires the tyvars to be distinct.

The invariant is checked by the ASSERT in lookupInstEnv'.

Note [Rough-match field]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The is_cls_nm, is_tcs fields allow a "rough match" to be done
*without* poking inside the DFunId.  Poking the DFunId forces
us to suck in all the type constructors etc it involves,
which is a total waste of time if it has no chance of matching
So the Name, [Maybe Name] fields allow us to say "definitely
does not match", based only on the Name.

In is_tcs, 
    Nothing  means that this type arg is a type variable

    (Just n) means that this type arg is a
                TyConApp with a type constructor of n.
                This is always a real tycon, never a synonym!
                (Two different synonyms might match, but two
                different real tycons can't.)
                NB: newtypes are not transparent, though!

Note [Proper-match fields]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The is_tvs, is_cls, is_tys fields are simply cached values, pulled
out (lazily) from the dfun id. They are cached here simply so 
that we don't need to decompose the DFunId each time we want 
to match it.  The hope is that the fast-match fields mean
that we often never poke the proper-match fields.

However, note that:
 * is_tvs must be a superset of the free vars of is_tys

 * is_tvs, is_tys may be alpha-renamed compared to the ones in
   the dfun Id

Note [Haddock assumptions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For normal user-written instances, Haddock relies on

 * the SrcSpan of
 * the Name of
 * the is_dfun of
 * an Instance

being equal to

  * the SrcSpan of
  * the instance head type of
  * the InstDecl used to construct the Instance.

instanceCantMatch _             _             =  False  -- Safe
\end{code}


Note [Overlapping instances]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overlap is permitted, but only in such a way that one can make
a unique choice when looking up.  That is, overlap is only permitted if
one template matches the other, or vice versa.  So this is ok:

  [a]  [Int]

but this is not

  (Int,a)  (b,Int)

If overlap is permitted, the list is kept most specific first, so that
the first lookup is the right choice.


For now we just use association lists.

\subsection{Avoiding a problem with overlapping}

Consider this little program:

\begin{pseudocode}
     class C a        where c :: a
     class C a => D a where d :: a

     instance C Int where c = 17
     instance D Int where d = 13

     instance C a => C [a] where c = [c]
     instance ({- C [a], -} D a) => D [a] where d = c

     instance C [Int] where c = [37]

     main = print (d :: [Int])
\end{pseudocode}

What do you think `main' prints  (assuming we have overlapping instances, and
all that turned on)?  Well, the instance for `D' at type `[a]' is defined to
be `c' at the same type, and we've got an instance of `C' at `[Int]', so the
answer is `[37]', right? (the generic `C [a]' instance shouldn't apply because
the `C [Int]' instance is more specific).

Ghc-4.04 gives `[37]', while ghc-4.06 gives `[17]', so 4.06 is wrong.  That
was easy ;-)  Let's just consult hugs for good measure.  Wait - if I use old
hugs (pre-September99), I get `[17]', and stranger yet, if I use hugs98, it
doesn't even compile!  What's going on!?

What hugs complains about is the `D [a]' instance decl.

\begin{pseudocode}
     ERROR "mj.hs" (line 10): Cannot build superclass instance
     *** Instance            : D [a]
     *** Context supplied    : D a
     *** Required superclass : C [a]
\end{pseudocode}

You might wonder what hugs is complaining about.  It's saying that you
need to add `C [a]' to the context of the `D [a]' instance (as appears
in comments).  But there's that `C [a]' instance decl one line above
that says that I can reduce the need for a `C [a]' instance to the
need for a `C a' instance, and in this case, I already have the
necessary `C a' instance (since we have `D a' explicitly in the
context, and `C' is a superclass of `D').

Unfortunately, the above reasoning indicates a premature commitment to the
generic `C [a]' instance.  I.e., it prematurely rules out the more specific
instance `C [Int]'.  This is the mistake that ghc-4.06 makes.  The fix is to
add the context that hugs suggests (uncomment the `C [a]'), effectively
deferring the decision about which instance to use.

Now, interestingly enough, 4.04 has this same bug, but it's covered up
in this case by a little known `optimization' that was disabled in
4.06.  Ghc-4.04 silently inserts any missing superclass context into
an instance declaration.  In this case, it silently inserts the `C
[a]', and everything happens to work out.

(See `basicTypes/MkId:mkDictFunId' for the code in question.  Search for
`Mark Jones', although Mark claims no credit for the `optimization' in
question, and would rather it stopped being called the `Mark Jones
optimization' ;-)

So, what's the fix?  I think hugs has it right.  Here's why.  Let's try
something else out with ghc-4.04.  Let's add the following line:

    d' :: D a => [a]
    d' = c

Everyone raise their hand who thinks that `d :: [Int]' should give a
different answer from `d' :: [Int]'.  Well, in ghc-4.04, it does.  The
`optimization' only applies to instance decls, not to regular
bindings, giving inconsistent behavior.

Old hugs had this same bug.  Here's how we fixed it: like GHC, the
list of instances for a given class is ordered, so that more specific
instances come before more generic ones.  For example, the instance
list for C might contain:
    ..., C Int, ..., C a, ...  
When we go to look for a `C Int' instance we'll get that one first.
But what if we go looking for a `C b' (`b' is unconstrained)?  We'll
pass the `C Int' instance, and keep going.  But if `b' is
unconstrained, then we don't know yet if the more specific instance
will eventually apply.  GHC keeps going, and matches on the generic `C
a'.  The fix is to, at each step, check to see if there's a reverse
match, and if so, abort the search.  This prevents hugs from
prematurely chosing a generic instance when a more specific one
exists.

--Jeff

BUT NOTE [Nov 2001]: we must actually *unify* not reverse-match in
this test.  Suppose the instance envt had
    ..., forall a b. C a a b, ..., forall a b c. C a b c, ...
(still most specific first)
Now suppose we are looking for (C x y Int), where x and y are unconstrained.
        C x y Int  doesn't match the template {a,b} C a a b
but neither does 
        C a a b  match the template {x,y} C x y Int
But still x and y might subsequently be unified so they *do* match.

Simple story: unify, don't match.

@lookupInstEnv@ looks up in a @InstEnv@, using a one-way match.  Since

thing we are looking up can have an arbitrary "flexi" part.

Note [DFunInstType: instantiating types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A successful match is a ClsInst, together with the types at which
        the dfun_id in the ClsInst should be instantiated
The instantiating types are (Either TyVar Type)s because the dfun
might have some tyvars that *only* appear in arguments
        dfun :: forall a b. C a b, Ord b => D [a]
When we match this against D [ty], we return the instantiating types
        [Just ty, Nothing]
where the 'Nothing' indicates that 'b' can be freely instantiated.  
(The caller instantiates it to a flexi type variable, which will 
 presumably later become fixed via functional dependencies.)

Note [Incoherent instances]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For some classes, the choise of a particular instance does not matter, any one
is good. E.g. consider

        class D a b where { opD :: a -> b -> String }
        instance D Int b where ...
        instance D a Int where ...

        g (x::Int) = opD x x

For such classes this should work (without having to add an "instance D Int
Int", and using -XOverlappingInstances, which would then work). This is what
-XIncoherentInstances is for: Telling GHC "I don't care which instance you use;
if you can use one, use it."


Should this logic only work when all candidates have the incoherent flag, or
even when all but one have it? The right choice is the latter, which can be
justified by comparing the behaviour with how -XIncoherentInstances worked when
it was only about the unify-check (note [Overlapping instances]):

Example:
        class C a b c where foo :: (a,b,c)
        instance C [a] b Int
        instance [incoherent] [Int] b c
        instance [incoherent] C a Int c
Thanks to the incoherent flags,
        foo :: ([a],b,Int)
works: Only instance one matches, the others just unify, but are marked
incoherent.

So I can write
        (foo :: ([a],b,Int)) :: ([Int], Int, Int).
but if that works then I really want to be able to write
        foo :: ([Int], Int, Int)
as well. Now all three instances from above match. None is more specific than
another, so none is ruled out by the normal overlapping rules. One of them is
not incoherent, but we still want this to compile. Hence the
"all-but-one-logic".

The implementation is in insert_overlapping, where we remove matching
incoherent instances as long as there are are others.

Note [Binding when looking up instances]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When looking up in the instance environment, or family-instance environment,
we are careful about multiple matches, as described above in 
Note [Overlapping instances]

The key_tys can contain skolem constants, and we can guarantee that those
are never going to be instantiated to anything, so we should not involve
them in the unification test.  Example:
        class Foo a where { op :: a -> Int }
        instance Foo a => Foo [a]       -- NB overlap
        instance Foo [Int]              -- NB overlap
        data T = forall a. Foo a => MkT a
        f :: T -> Int
        f (MkT x) = op [x,x]
The op [x,x] means we need (Foo [a]).  Without the filterVarSet we'd
complain, saying that the choice of instance depended on the instantiation
of 'a'; but of course it isn't *going* to be instantiated.

We do this only for isOverlappableTyVar skolems.  For example we reject
        g :: forall a => [a] -> Int
        g x = op x
on the grounds that the correct instance depends on the instantiation of 'a'
