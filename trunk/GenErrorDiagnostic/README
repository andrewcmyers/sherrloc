SHErrLoc 1.0.0

			     The SHErrLoc Tool
			     ----------------

SHErrLoc (Static Holistic Error Locator) is an implementation of the general
error diagnostic approach described in the 2014 paper, "Toward General Diagnosis
of Static Errors", published in the Proceedings of the 41th ACM Symposium on
Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), January 2014, pp. 569-581, by
Danfeng Zhang and Andrew C. Myers. In a nutshell, SHErrLoc takes a constraint
file describing program analysis, and diagnoses the most likely cause of
errors detected by the static analysis.

Your installation directory contains the following sub-directories:

  - src:      the complete source code of the SHErrLoc tool
  - doc:      documentation 
  - lib:      needed JAR files
  - HTML:     needed style file and js files to show HTML reports
  - tests:    a collection of constraint files used to test the correctness of
              SHErrLoc

The installation diretory also contains a script "sherrloc" to run the SHErrLoc
tool in a convenient way.


Requirements
------------

The SHErrLoc tool is compiled with the Ant build tool
(http://jakarta.apache.org/ant). You must ensure that java and javac are in
your path.

Softare Versions: We recommend that you use JDK 1.6.0 or later.  Ant
   1.8.2 is known to work with SHErrLoc 1.0.0.

This SHErrLoc distribution contains the files JFlex.jar and java-cup-11a.jar and
commons-cli-1.2.jar. These files are required to build.

Building SHErrLoc
------------

SHErrLoc is compiled with the Ant build tool (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant).
Follow these steps to build the SHErrLoc tool:

1. Ensure javac is on your path and that you are using JDK 1.6.0 or
   later. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the Java home
   directory.

2. Go to the root directory of the SHErrLoc installation (the directory
   this README is in). We'll call this directory $HOME from now on.

    $ cd $HOME

3. Run ant to build the SHErrLoc tool.

        $ ant

   This compiles the $HOME/src.

   The resulting .class files for the source code in $HOME/src, will be stored
   in $HOME/classes.


7. You are now ready to try out SHErrLoc. A suggested starting point is
   ... (TODO: add some examples in the release) 


Running SHErrLoc
-----------

A scripts named "sherrloc" is available in the $HOME directory. The sherrloc
script provides a convenient way to execute the compiled SHErrLoc code.

The command line options for SHErrLoc can be viewed by running sherrloc with
the "-h" flag:
    $ $HOME/sherrloc -h

usage: diagnostic <options> <constraint file>
 -c         generate likely wrong constraints
 -d         output the constraint graph as a DOT file
 -e         generate likely wrong constraint elements
 -f         show full constraint graph (use with -d)
 -h         generate likely missing hypothesis
 -n <arg>   number of suboptimal suggestions to report. Default value is
            zero
 -o <arg>   output file
 -r         allow recursion (e.g., x = list x)
 -s <arg>   name the source file that generated the constraints
 -u         unified report with wrong constraint elements and missing
            hypothesis (experimental)
 -v         verbose mode (for evaluation)
 -w         HTML report

See the SHErrLoc documentation ($HOME/doc/index.html) for more information
about using SHErrLoc. See the directory $HOME/tests for some examples of
constraint inputs.
