This is the OCaml test case for error diagnostic tool.

To run the test, change the configuration of $ezyocaml and $diagnostic to the
home directory of EasyOcaml and diagnostic tool respectively. Then simply run
the script.

The script skips tests that already succeeds before. Use argument "clean" to
clean up all cmo files and test all files from scratch.
