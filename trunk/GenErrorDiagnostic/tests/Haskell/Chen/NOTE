p106 doesn't seem to be a good test, 
fail3 p [] = p + p                                      ^M
fail3 p (h:t) = if p True then [h] else t^M
seems should be if True then ...

p11, seems the cause described is wrong

p19, seems there is only one way to fix the program
test = xs : "def"^M
       where xs = "abc"^M

p67, an wrong entity is blame due the to way constraints are generated 

p9 should reveal the unsoundness of SHErrLoc
