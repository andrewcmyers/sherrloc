AllExamples.hs contains all of the 121 Haskell programs provided by Chen and
Erwig, used in their POPL paper. I've added the error locations, as described
by text in this benchmark when available, to automate the evaluation.

The script "seperate_files.pl" separates the 121 programs into their own files
(from p1 to p121). Then we can run "runtest.pl" to evaluate the quality of
reported error locations.

The script "combine_files.pl" is used to generate AllExamples.hs with newly
updated error locations.


Some issues in the rest files:

p106 doesn't seem to be a good test, 
fail3 p [] = p + p                                      ^M
fail3 p (h:t) = if p True then [h] else t^M
seems should be if True then ...

p11, seems the cause described is wrong

p19, seems there is only one way to fix the program
test = xs : "def"^M
       where xs = "abc"^M

p67, an wrong entity is blamed due the to way constraints are generated 

p9 and p37 appeared to reveal the unsoundness of SHErrLoc, when it diagnoses on
the simplified constraints. But it successfully identifies errors when more
information is dumped from GHC.
