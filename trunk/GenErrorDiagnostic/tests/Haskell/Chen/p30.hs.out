Compiling p30.hs
(7,17)-(7,29): Type error in else branch of conditional
 expression       : if c then \g x -> g x else \e y -> y e
 term             : \e y -> y e
   type           : a        -> (a -> b) -> b
   does not match : (c -> d) -> c        -> d
 because          : unification would give infinite type
