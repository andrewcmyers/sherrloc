    Couldn't match expected type `[[String]] -> [Int]'
                with actual type `[Int]'
    The function `map' is applied to three arguments,
    but its type `([a0] -> Int) -> [[a0]] -> [Int]' has only two
    In the expression: map length firstColumn n
    In an equation for `lengthColumn':
        lengthColumn n = map length firstColumn n
