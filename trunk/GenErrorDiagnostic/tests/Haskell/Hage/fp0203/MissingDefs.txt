Group11,31,92,97 are skipped since the only file that has type errors is OK in
GHC (error due to the misuse of +/* and +./*.)

Group43, 75, 93,98 do not have any file that constains type checking errors.
Group46 only has one file with type checking error. The error cause is
unclear.
Group37 is a very concise example where signature is wrong
