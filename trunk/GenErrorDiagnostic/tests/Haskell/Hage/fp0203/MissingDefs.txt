fp0203:
Group11,31,92,97 are skipped since the only file that has type errors is OK in
GHC (error due to the misuse of +/* and +./*.)

Group43, 75, 93,98 do not have any file that constains type checking errors.
Group46 only has one file with type checking error. The error cause is
unclear.
Group37 is a very concise example where signature is wrong

fp0304:
group0, 11, 111, 113 have no files with errors

Group110 are skipped since the only file that has type errors is OK in
GHC (error due to the misuse of +/* and +./*.)

group114 seems the signature is more likely to be wrong, but actually,
both uses are wrong
